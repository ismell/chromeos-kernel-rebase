Subject: [PATCH] CHROMIUM: Disable 'constant-conversion' warning for clang

There are only a few instances of this warning upstream, however there is
some resistance against fixing them. Disable the warning in our tree since
we treat warnings as errors.

BUG=chromium:809829
TEST=build for grunt with clang
  => no 'constant-conversion' warnings
